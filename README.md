# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
    📈Project Objective
    The aim of the project is to predict credit card fraud cases.

    📈Project Dataset
    The dataset consists of 5626 rows with 50 independent variables, 1 target value, and 1 index key. It is an imbalanced dataset.

    📈Problem and Expectation
    The problem is to predict the target value (1 or 0) while considering the following formulation as the evaluation metric:

     🔎Recall (0) / Recall (1) <= 0.025
     🔎(Recall (0) + Recall (1)) / 2 >= 0.75

The goal is to achieve a high overall recall (sensitivity) while maintaining a balanced recall between the positive (fraud) and negative (non-fraud) classes.
